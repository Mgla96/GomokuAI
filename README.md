# GomokuAI
Created an AI to play Gomoku, otherwise known as Five in a Row. Gomoku is like tic-tac-toe except with larger game boards and the requirement of 5 of the same type of stone(a player's game piece) in a row to win. This AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning and an optimized method of searching in order to determine the best move relatively quickly.
